## Binaries

Users are recommended to use the [pre-built xemu binaries](https://github.com/mborgerson/xemu/wiki#download). If you would like to build from source however, follow the instructions for your platform below.

## Windows

Windows builds are cross-compiled from Ubuntu. If you would like to build *on* Windows, you can use WSL2 and Docker. See [official Docker
documentation](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/wsl/) for how to get WSL2 and Docker set up.

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/mborgerson/xemu.git
docker run -u $(id -u):$(id -g) --rm -v $PWD/xemu:/xemu -w /xemu \
    -e CCACHE_DIR=/xemu/ccache \
    mborgerson/xemu-ubuntu-win64-cross:latest \
    ./build.sh -p win64-cross

# Run
./xemu/dist/xemu.exe
```

## macOS

First install the [Homebrew package manager](https://brew.sh/).

```bash
# Install dependencies
brew update
brew install coreutils pkg-config dylibbundler ninja
python3 -m pip install pyyaml

# Clone and build
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/mborgerson/xemu.git
cd xemu
./build.sh

# Run
open ./dist/xemu.app
```

## Linux

=== "Debian/Ubuntu"

    ```bash
    # Install dependencies
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install git build-essential libsdl2-dev libepoxy-dev libpixman-1-dev libgtk-3-dev libssl-dev libsamplerate0-dev libpcap-dev ninja-build python3-yaml

    # Clone and build
    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/mborgerson/xemu.git
    cd xemu
    ./build.sh

    # Run
    ./dist/xemu
    ```

=== "Arch Linux"

    ```bash
    # Install dependencies
    sudo pacman -S --noconfirm git base-devel sdl2 libepoxy pixman gtk3 openssl libsamplerate libpcap ninja glu python-yaml

    # Clone and build
    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/mborgerson/xemu.git
    cd xemu
    ./build.sh

    # Run
    ./dist/xemu
    ```

=== "Fedora"

    ```bash
    # Install dependencies
    sudo dnf install libdrm-devel libslirp-devel mesa-libGLU-devel gtk3-devel libpcap-devel libsamplerate-devel libaio-devel SDL2-devel libepoxy-devel pixman-devel gcc-c++ ninja-build openssl-devel python3-pyyaml

    # Clone and build
    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/mborgerson/xemu.git
    cd xemu
    ./build.sh

    # Run
    ./dist/xemu
    ```

!!! tip "Tip: Building with Clang, or another specific compiler"

    If you have multiple toolchains and would like to build with specific one,
    such as clang, you can specify the compiler and linker through environment
    variables when invoking build.sh as follows:

    ```bash
    CC=clang CXX=clang++ CC_LD=lld CXX_LD=lld AR=llvm-ar ./build.sh
    ```

!!! tip "Tip: Passing build flags to the C/C++ compiler"

    Extra build flags can be passed to the C/C++ compiler by using environment
    variables in a similar manner to changing toolchains. The CFLAGS variable
    sets C compiler flags and the CXXFLAGS variable sets C++ compiler flags.
    Multiple flags can be set by separating them with a space, just be sure to
    surround it in quotations. For example, if you wanted to build xemu with
    extra optimizations for your specific CPU then you would invoke build.sh
    as follows:

    ```bash
    CFLAGS="-march=native" CXXFLAGS="-march=native" ./build.sh
    ```
