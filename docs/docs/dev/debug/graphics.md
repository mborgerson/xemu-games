!!! tip "Tip: Testing"

    These NV2A [unit tests](https://github.com/abaire/nxdk_pgraph_tests){target=_blank} are a great way to isolate and troubleshoot graphical differences between xemu and real hardware.

    The [snapshot](../../snapshots.md) feature within xemu is another convenient way to quickly test problem areas without having to repeatedly play through large sections of a game.

    There are also other tools such as [RenderDoc]([https://renderdoc.org]){target=_blank}, [Nsight]([https://developer.nvidia.com/nsight-systems]){target=_blank}, and [nv2a-trace]([https://github.com/XboxDev/nv2a-trace]){target=_blank} which are good ways to get started into graphics debugging!
