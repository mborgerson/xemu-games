#### Q: Can I get some help?
Of course, but first please read through the [setup guide](download.md). If you still have questions, please read the following FAQs. If you're still having problems, head to #help in the xemu Discord server.

#### Q: I think I've found a bug, what do I do?
Join the Discord server and chat about what you're seeing in #general, maybe it's a known issue. We can work together to get it recorded and fixed.

#### Q: Are there system requirements?
See [here](about.md#system-requirements).

#### Q: What BIOS do I need to use?
Your MCPX and BIOS dump should be for a 1.0 Xbox. It's suggested that your MCPX dump be 1.0 and that a compatible BIOS image be used (users have reported success with "COMPLEX 4627").

#### Q: Do I need to have an EEPROM file?
A default one will be created if you do not provide one.

#### Q: Why am I getting `The guest has not initialized the display`
This is likely due to a mismatch of MCPX and BIOS images, or a corrupt MCPX boot ROM.

#### Q: Why am I getting `Please insert an Xbox disc...`? I already loaded an ISO.
Try restarting xemu. If you continue to get the message, your ISO may not be dumped in a compatible way. Try using [extract-xiso](https://github.com/xboxdev/extract-xiso) to pack your ISO.

#### Q: Is there a game compatibility list?
Yes, visit https://xemu.app

#### Q: Does game `x`  work?
Possibly. [Check the compatibility list](https://xemu.app) first if you're curious, or try it out for yourself. You are invited to submit a compatibility report too.

#### Q: Does xemu run my game's `default.xbe`?
No, not directly. xemu emulates the hardware of the system, so you'll need to have a disc image of your game backup. You can use [extract-xiso](https://github.com/xboxdev/extract-xiso) or qwix to create an image.

#### Q: Does xemu support "redump" style ISOs?
No, not yet. You can however convert a redump style ISO to a compatible ISO. More info [here](<https://xemu.app/docs/disc-images/#about-redump-isos>).

#### Q: Why am I getting an `Assertion failed!` message?
When a game exercises a piece of code in xemu that has not yet been implemented or verified, xemu will `assert`  which forces execution to stop. The reason for this is that anything happening beyond that point may be unpredictable and significantly increase the debugging burden.

#### Q: How do I enable widescreen mode?
You can change the setting in your [dashboard](dashboard.md) or use the [EEPROM editor](eeprom.md) to enable widescreen. Then select 'Scale (Widescreen 16:9)' in xemu View scaling mode. Note: not all games support widescreen.

#### Q: How can I increase the resolution?
For all titles the rendering resolution can be easily scaled by navigating to View&rarr;Rendering Scale. For titles that natively support higher resolutions, you can enable the associated mode in your dashboard or by using the [EEPROM editor](eeprom.md).

#### Q: Are there any plans for a mobile port of xemu?
There are currently no plans for a mobile port of xemu on iOS or Android, the emulator hasn't reached the performance necessary to run well on iOS or Android at this time.

#### Q: Can xemu load an Xbox game disc from my computer's DVD drive?
Generally, no. You will need to create a backup of your game disc. Please [see here](disc-images.md) for more information about creating and using disc images.

#### Q: Why does xemu crash when I enable Surround Sound in my EEPROM?
This is because Surround Sound isn't implemented in xemu yet, please disable this in your [EEPROM](eeprom.md) if you have it enabled.
